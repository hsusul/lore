# POLISH_LOG.md — Continuous Polish and Improvement Loop

> Durable log of small, verified improvements across all lenses.
> Maintained autonomously on `polish-loop` branch.

## Iteration 1
- **Lens:** Correctness bugs
- **Change:** Support backslash (`\`) path separators and Windows-style traversal in `sanitize_path` (`crates/lore-core/src/adapters/common.rs`).
- **Critique:**
  - `sanitize_path` previously only split on forward slashes `/`.
  - Windows-style paths or agent tool arguments containing `\` with traversal (e.g. `..\..\etc\passwd`) were treated as single segments and not stripped.
  - Separators were not normalized to `/`.
  - Fix: Split on `['/', '\\']` in `sanitize_path` so traversal elements are popped and paths are cleanly normalized with `/`.
- **Validation Results:**
  - `cargo test --workspace`: 74 passed across lore-core, lore-ipc, lore-app (2 scale/dev ignored).
  - `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings`: Clean (0 warnings).
  - `npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm test`: Clean; 10 test files passed (85 tests).
- **Backlog Candidates Noticed:**
  1. *Missing tests/edge cases:* `DiscoveryConfig::roots_for` returns default if empty list is passed or absent, but `owner_of` canonicalization behavior with trailing slashes or relative paths under custom roots can be edge-case tested.
  2. *Error handling:* `crates/lore-core/src/backup.rs` `restore_backup` removes destination DB on restore without atomic staging/rename or transactional fallback if subsequent integrity check fails.
  3. *Performance/allocations:* `crates/lore-core/src/query.rs` `keyset_after` constructs formatted strings and vectors for every keyset page; can optimize string allocations.
